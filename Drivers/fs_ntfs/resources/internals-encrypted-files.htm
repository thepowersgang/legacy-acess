        <H1 align=center>EFS - Encrypting File System. Encrypted Files and Folders 
          (NTFS5 only)</H1>
        <p><strong>EFS Internals</strong></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><b>EFS uses symmetric key encryption in combination with public key 
            technology to protect files.</b> File data is being encrypted with symmetric 
            algorithm (DESX). The key, used in symmetric encryption is called 
            <em>File Encryption Key</em> (FEK). The FEK in its own turn is encrypted 
            with a public/private key algorithm (RSA) and stored along with the 
            file. The reason why two different algorithms are used is the speed 
            of encryption. The performance burden of asymmetric algorithms is 
            too much to use them for encrypting a large amount of data. Symmetric 
            algorithms are about 1000 times faster making their suitable for encrypting 
            of large amounts of data.</p>
          <p>As a first setp to encrypt file, NTFS creates a log file called Efs0.log 
            in System Volume Information folder on the same drive, as encrypted 
            file. Then EFS aquires access CryptoAPI context. It uses Microsoft 
            Base Cryptographic Provider 1.0 as cryptographic provider. Having 
            the crypto context open, EFS generate File Encryption Key (FEK). </p>
          <p>The next step is to get public/private key pair; if it does not exist 
            at this stage (the case when EFS invoked first time), EFS generate 
            a new pair. EFS uses 1024-bit RSA algorithm to encrypt FEK. </p>
          <p>Then, EFS creates Data Decryption Field (DDF) for the current user, 
            where it places FEK and encrypts it with public key. If recovery agent 
            is defined by system policy, EFS creates also Data Recovery Field 
            (DRF) and places there FEK encrypted with public key of recover agent. 
            A separate DRA is created for every recovery agent defined. Please 
            note, that on Windows XP not included into domain, there's no recovery 
            agent is defined, so this step is omitted.</p>
          <p>Now a temporary file Efs0.tmp is created in the same folder as the 
            file being encrypted. The contents of original file (plain text) is 
            copied into temporary file, after that the original is overwritten 
            with encrypted data. By default, EFS uses DESX algorithm with 128-bit 
            key to encrypt file data, but Windows could be also configured to 
            use stronger 3DES algorithm with 168-bit key. In that case FIPS compliant 
            algorithms usage must be turned on in LSA policy (it is disabled by 
            default):</p>
          <p><img src="images/fips.gif" width="405" height="288"></p>
          <p>EFS uses the registry to determine if it will use DESX or 3DES. If 
            HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\FipsAlgorithmPolicy = 1, 
            then 3DES will be used. If not, then EFS checks HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows 
            NT\CurrentVersion\EFS\AlgorithmID (this value may not be present); 
            if present, it will have ID CALG_3DES or CALG_DESX, otherwise, DESX 
            should be used.<br>
          </p>
          <p>After encryption is done, temporary and log files are deleted.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="images/encryption.gif" width="458" height="253"></p>
          <p>After file is encrypted, only users who has correspondent DDF or 
            DRF can access the file. This mechanism is separate from common security 
            meaning that beside rights to access file, the file must have its 
            FEK encrypted with user's public key. Only user who can decrypt FEK 
            with his own private key, can access the file. The consequence is, 
            that user, who has access to the file, can encrypt it thus preventing 
            the owner to access his own file. Initially only one DDF is created 
            for user who encrypts the file, but later he can add extra users to 
            key ring. In this case EFS simply decrypts FEK with private key of 
            user who wants to give access to the file to another user, and encrypts 
            FEK with public key of target user, thus creating a new DDF which 
            is stored along with the first one.</p>
          <p>The decryption process is opposite to encryption:</p>
          <p><img src="images/decryption.gif" width="460" height="255"></p>
          <p>First, system checks if user has a private key used by EFS. If yes, 
            it reads EFS attributes and walk through the DDF ring looking for 
            DDF for current user. If DDF is found, user's private key is used 
            to decrypt FEK extracted from DDF. Using decrypted FEK, EFS decrypts 
            file data. It should be noticed that file never decrypted in whole 
            but rather by sectors when upper level module requests particular 
            sector.</p>
          <p>Recovery process is similar to decryption, except that it uses the 
            recovery agent's private key to decrypt the FEK in the DRF, not in 
            DDF:</p>
          <p><img src="images/recovery.gif" width="461" height="254"> 
          </p>
          <p>DRA policy is implemented differently for Windows 2000 and Windows 
            XP. In Windows 2000 by default on computers, not included into domain, 
            local Administrator is added to Public Key Policy as Encrypted Data 
            Recovery Agent. So, when user encrypts file, both DDF and DRF fields 
            are created. If the last DRA is deleted, the whole EFS functionality 
            is turned off and it is not possible to encrypt file anymore.</p>
          <p><img src="images/no_agent.gif" width="370" height="172"></p>
          <p>In Windows XP the situation is different. Since majority of home 
            users working standalone do not need anybody else to be able to decrypt 
            file except themselves, there's no need in data recovery agents, so 
            there's no DRA included into Public Key Policy and EFS works without 
            DRA. In this case only DDF field is created for encrypted file.</p>
